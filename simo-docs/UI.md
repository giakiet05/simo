# 1. Overview Screen
- Add balance
- Add charts
- Add recent transactions (5 items) and a more button, which will navigate to the transaction screen.

# 2. Transaction Screen
## 2.1 List screen
- Add a kebab menu (3 vertical dots) with 2 options edit and delete (next to amount) or hold the item to open the menu (which is better in your opinion? I think the hold approach is better for visualization, but remember to add a short hint for user about this action)
- The order of information in one item should be: category -> time -> note. The category will be bold, not the note like in current state. If note doesn't exist, omit it, don't show "No note".
- The + button at the bottom right should only exist in the overview and transaction screens to add transactions. In the category and recurring screens, that button will appear at top right position (same line with the title of the screen), and explicitly names  it  "+ Add".  
## 2.2. Add screen
- In add transactions screen, add more and save all buttons are still overlapped  with the navigation buttons of the phone, move them up a little more. 
- In Vietnamese mode, there are some untranslated words: "item", "optional". The value of the buttons and input forms are bad, consider changing them like this: "Số tiền công thức" -> "Số tiền" (remove the example too), "Chi tiêu" -> "Chi tiêu (-)", "Thu nhập" -> "Thu nhập (+)", "Thêm nữa" -> "Thêm giao dịch mới" (I dont like this button's position, I want it to appear below the last transaction in the screen), "Lưu tất cả" -> "Lưu" ("Save" in English)
